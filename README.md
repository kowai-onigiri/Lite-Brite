# Lite-Brite

This project is derived from my Etch-a-Sketch with a few modifications. My intention was for it to resemble the retro toy "Lite-Brite." 
I updated the design, changed the button colors from black and rainbow to glowing neon red, blue, yellow, green, purple, and rainbow.

Future updates pending:
I would like to make the design even more retro and visually appealing, and I'd like to switch the drawing effect from following the mouse hover to a mouse down and 
trailing type mechanism.

I would like to make a further variation of this project that resembles a Nintendo DS picta-chat.
